You will need C++ and Perl. For porting hints for other systems than Linux
see PORTING file.

To build BridgeDealer run from its top-level directory (which contains this
file) following commands:

perl ./Makefile.PL
make

Once BridgeDealer has been built correctly, run:

make install

For Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 it will install script parser 'BridgeDealer' in
'/usr/bin' and Perl modules in '/usr/local/lib/site_perl'.

NOTE: You might have to change few things in script parser's configuration
part to bring BridgeDealer to life on your system.

NOTE: For Win32 Strawberry Perl you would need to edit paths in bin/BridgeDealer
as following:

    # Directory where 'BridgeDealer.dh' resides
    $libdir = "C:/strawberry/perl/site/lib/BridgeDealer/";

    # Perl executable path followed by its name
    $perlpath = "C:/strawberry/perl/bin/perl.exe";

    # Temporary files directory
    $tempdir = "C:/windows/Temp";
