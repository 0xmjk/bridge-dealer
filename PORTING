BridgeDealer needs Perl and C++. It should be portable to many systems. You
might have a problems with:

1) 'unsigned long long int' type (64 bits)
        which is used to hold deck data.

2) the random generator (in 'dealer.cc' file)

   Dealer::init_rand
        which initialises pseudo-random generator with a seed taken from
        system generator (using Linux-specific device /dev/random).

   Dealer::rndcard
        which uses drand48() function for more read carefully 'dealer.cc'

3) your Perl distribution must have ExtUtils::MakeMaker module, it is used
   to build Makefile.
