I found this in my attic today :)
It's a little project I've written roughly 16 years ago, as a kid.
Below is its original README. Enjoy.

BridgeDealer - hand dealing system
Copyright (c) 2000 Michal J. Kubski
All rights reserved.

1 INTRODUCTION

BridgeDealer is a hand dealing system for bridge players. It is written in
C++ (speed critical part), and Perl. It consists of Perl extension (in C++),
Perl module and script parser (in Perl) which uses XML-like grammar.

It is currently known to run under:
                Linux version 2.2.x (i386)

If you use it on other systems and/or architectures let me know about that.

BridgeDealer is free only for non-commercial use (for details read LICENSE
file). If you like this program or want to share your ideas send me e-mail.
I would be grateful if you send me your modifications, and scripts created
in BridgeDealer (they shall appear on its website).

2 THANKS

I would like to thank Jerzy H. Kubski, because
BridgeDealer would not ever come to life without his bridge-oriented
enthusiasm.

'vector', 'shapeclass', 'shape' and 'pattern' functions are inspired by Deal
written by Thomas Andrews <thomaso@best.com>.
